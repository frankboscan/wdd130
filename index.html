      <p>I am a computer science major from Utah. I moved to France in 2016. My wife and I have two beautiful sons. I can't wait for more. To quote King Solomon, "As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them" (Psalm 127:4-5). Clear, succinct, and spoken with the wisdom of a man who speaks from experience. I also enjoy rigorous exercise and unhealthy fast food. No, they are not incompatible: the former enables a hearty amount of the latter! I can't wait to tie this all together. When my boys get older, I will most definitely spend a hearty amount of time at the gym with them. More muscle mass will let us all eat burgers, fries, and shakes guilt-free. Literally no down-sides to this.</p>
      <p>My favorite temples are the following:
        <ul class="box">

          <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/spokane-washington-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Spokane</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/salt-lake-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Salt Lake City</a></li>
        </ul>

      <p>Ah, yes. France. Largest country in the EU by surface area. Voted top EU country to have children by the fertility rate charts. And the undisputed tourism champion by any reasonable metric. Vive la République, vive la France !</p>
